                <div class="recipes-desc"> This delicious citrusy dessert crepe is an amazing dessert for those who love
                    fruity flavors that
                    aren't too strong. However, this dessert can be a little advanced so it's recommended to be able to
                    make crepes on their own first. The cake is constructed carefully layer by layer with each
                    containing a cream frosting and crepe until it's the size of a normal cake. Lastly, you can choose
                    to garnish it with powdered sugar and spiraled limes or lime zest.</div>

                <div class="recipes-desc"> How to make homemade doughnuts that are slightly crispy on the outside and
                    beautifuly airy on the inside! These fluffy and airy homemade doughnuts are perfect for any
                    occasion! They’re extremely versatile
                    and can be made into millions of different flavors. You can start with a vanilla doughnut and create
                    different flavored glazes for a large selection of flavored doughnuts. The glaze is very easy to
                    make using 2 cups of powdered sugar ¼ cups of milk and ½ a teaspoon of whatever flavoring you want
                    to use. You can also choose to add food coloring if you want different colored doughnuts and then
                    all you’d have to do is mix the glaze and dip the doughnuts into them. Optionally you can also top
                    your doughnuts with sprinkles, fresh fruit, other desserts, cereal, or whatever else your heart
                    desires.</div>

                    or you can do chocolate cake and strawberry mousse, or do a mix of both. There are so many ways to

                <div class="recipes-desc"> If you love the taste of tropical fruits, you'll love this mango cupcake
                    recipe! Mango Cupcakes are the perfect harmony of tropical and comforting cake, personally as a
                    fruit and
                    mango lover these cupcakes are to die for. The way the flavor of the mango perfectly compliments the
                    texture of the sponge cake is incredible. Not to mention the diced mangos that filled the cupcake
                    itself along with the subtle mango-flavored buttercream. The important part of tropical flavored
                    cakes is to not overdo the flavoring which is why it’s much better to use actual fruit instead of
                    artificial flavorings in these cakes.</div>
